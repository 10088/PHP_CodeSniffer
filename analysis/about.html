            <h1>Analysis of Coding Conventions <span class="repoName">About the reports</span></h1>
            <p>An ongoing <a href="./index.html">analysis of coding conventions</a> is being conducted across a range of PHP projects. This document explains how to read the combined and individual project reports that have been produced.</p>

                <h2><a href="#types">Types of Reports</a></h2>
                <p>The analysis of coding conventions produces both a <strong>combined report</strong> and then an individual <strong>project report</strong> for each project that has been analysed.</p>
                <p>While the reports look similar, the combined report includes features that help find trends and popular coding conventions across a wide range of PHP projects, while the project reports include features to determine how consistently a project applies their preferred coding conventions.</p>
                <p>If you are viewing the combined report, you can click the <strong>View Project Specific Report</strong> link at the top of the page to display a list of all projects that have been analysed. Clicking any of these projects will take you to its individual report page. If you are viewing a project report, an additional <strong>View Combined Report</strong> link is available to take you back to the combined report. The link also displays the number of PHP projects that have been analysed.</p>
                <p>The footer of the report shows the date that it was last generated. Project reports additionally show the Github repository and branch they are generated from, and the commit ID of the last commit that was included in the report.</p>

                <p>A coding standard is made up of a number of coding conventions, each with a preferred style. </p>

                        For each coding convention, the different style variations that have been found within are determined and displayed in a pie graph. The most popular style variation is marked with a star in the graph legend.<br/><br/>
                        For the combined report, each section of the pie graph represents the percentage of all analysed PHP code that conforms to a specific style variation.<br/><br/>
                        For individual project reports, each section of the pie graph represents the percentage of project code that conforms to a specific style variation.

                        When viewing the combined report, a second pie graph is displayed within the main one. This inner pie graph shows the percentage of PHP projects that are using each style variation.<br/><br/>
                        If the inner and outer pie graphs do not align, it is likely that a large PHP project is skewing the results. In the example on the left, the winning style variation is used in 50% of all PHP code, but it is the not the preferred variation for most PHP projects. For this reason, it is also important to look at the percentage of projects that prefer each style variation, which is displayed in the graph legend and looks like this:<br/><br/>
                        <a class="preferredByLink" href="" onclick="return false;">preferred by 40% of projects</a><br/><br/>
                        Clicking the link will show a list of the PHP projects that prefer that style variation. Clicking a project in that list will take you to the coding convention on the project's individual report.

                        When viewing a project report, a flag is shown to the top right of the graph legend. A blue flag with a white star indicates that the project prefers the most commonly used style variation across all PHP projects, while a white flag indicates that the project prefers a different variation.

                    The style variations used for each coding convention are tracked over time so that trends can be identified in the data. New data is collected weekly and the results displayed in a line graph at the bottom of each coding convention. Each style variation is plotted on a separate line but uses the same colour as it does in the coding convention pie graphs. Hovering over the graph displays the values at each point in time.

                <p>
                    If a large enough swing is detected for a week's data, the point on the line graph will be displayed slightly larger and the events that contributed to the swing will be listed under the graph. In the example above, large swings in the data were seen on the 13th Nov and the 18th Dec.

                        <li><a href="#">Project A</a> saw a 70% swing from <em>yes</em> to <em>no</em></li>

                <p>
                    There are two types of events that can lead to swings in the trend data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A project changed their preferred style variation</li>
                        <li>A project added or removed lines of code that apply to the coding convention</li>
                    </ul>
                    When viewing the combined report, the project that caused each event will be displayed and linked to. This information is omitted from project reports as the trend data displayed there is specific to the individual project's code and is not influenced by any other projects.

                    Each project is given a grade that indicates how consistently the project's preferred coding conventions are applied throughout the project. The grades available are <strong><span class="green">A(+/-)</span></strong>, <strong><span class="blue">B(+/-)</span></strong>, <strong><span class="yellow">C(+/-)</span></strong>, <strong><span class="orange">D(+/-)</span></strong> and <strong><span class="red">F</span></strong> and each is displayed inside a sash at the top right corner of the project report.

                    Clicking on the sash will display the percentage of code consistency across the as well as instructions for embedding a badge that can be used to display a project's grade and link to the project's report. The badges look like this:
